for Denver Open Source Users Group (DOSUG 2014-MAY)

At the http://www.meetup.com/DOSUG1/events/162145732/[May DOSUG meetup], I had the opportunity to present with a co-worker on https://boxen.github.com/[Boxen], a tool for automating installation and configuration for Macs.  Our slides can be found http://itgumby.github.io/boxen-slides/[on my] and http://jdigger.github.io/boxen-slides/[Jim's].
