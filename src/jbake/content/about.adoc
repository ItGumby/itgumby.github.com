Brian Street is a Software Engineer that believes in pragmatic solutions.  Also, smart people accomplish great solutions in all platforms and environments - so don't hold your preconceptions too tightly.  That being said, some environments/languages/platforms are more pleasurable to work with than others.

Brian's work experience has covered:

* Scripting & Automation
* JVM languages
* Full-Stack development on a CMS
* Site Conversions
* Data Conversions (especially ETL/Extract-Transform-Load)
* Data Warehouses
* Performance Testing
* Software Quality Assurance (especialy automated)
* Factory Automation & Motion Control

The name "IT Gumby" evolved from an old Saturday Night Live skit mashed up with the author's love of technology.
