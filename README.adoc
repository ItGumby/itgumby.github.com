== Converting to http://jbake.org/

(Previously, on blogger, Octopress)

== Process

. Ensure source branch `git checkout source`
. Create & edit post file(s) `src/jbake/content/blog/YYYY/url.adoc`
. build static content
.. `./gradlew --no-daemon jbake`
.. `jbake -b src/jbake build/ghpages` (handier for troubleshooting logs)
. preview content `jbake -s build/ghpages`
. publish content **IN THEORY** `./gradlew publish`
** "Skipping task ':prepareGhPages' as it has no source files."
** "Skipping task ':publishGhPages' as task onlyIf is false"
** manual alternate:
.. checkout master branch into a different folder
.. copy build/ghpages/* to master branch folder
.. git: add files & push to master branch


=== Completed:

* jbake structure
* convert existing content
* carry over customized CSS
* tweak freemarker templates
* gradle build

=== TODO:

* [ ] gradle publish
* [ ] update README for gh-pages, build steps
